<div class="well"><h1>PostHoc Release / Download</h1>

<p>PostHoc is a email server that "catches" all email for review, and never forwards email on to anything else.</p>

<p>PostHoc is great for testing software that sends email.  PostHoc looks like a standard SMTP email server.  But it also has a web interface that anyone can use to review all email that was sent.  There is no need to log in, all email to any address is made available through the UI without logging in.   You can create outbox messages which can then be picked up using POP protocol to test your software ability to receive email.   Mail is automatically deleted after 5 days.   Email can be displayed as regular message, as uninterpreted HTML so you can see the HTML codes, and as raw SMTP format if you want to see the details of the message that was sent.</p>
